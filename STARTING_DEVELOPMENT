Development instructions for TouchKit add-on

The project as checked out from git has two maven sub-projects; cval, agpl. 
You can import these separately into Eclipse in addition to the root project.

In the root, you can use
% mvn package (produces jar/zip for agpl/cval in respective 'target' folders)

Development is mainly done in the agpl project. There you can run
% mvn vaadin:compile (compile the widgetset, must before running TestServer)
% mvn install (installs the package in your local maven repo)
% mvn vaadin:debug (starts gwt hosted mode, waits for remote debugger)
% mvn vaadin:run-codeserver (starts "superdevmode" server)

The TestServer class can be run as a Java application. It will start a Jetty
server on http://localhost:7777 for testing and development.

Note that you must do mvn vaadin:compile before running the TestServer.

Tests that implement AbstractTouchKitTest are listed automatically on default
screen and can be started by their name (fully qualified or short name).

Automated integration tests are kept in a separate project:
vaadin-touchkit-integration-tests. It builds a war file and during install
phase also executes integration test scripts automatically. TestBench (WebDriver
based) is used to execute tests. See README in that project for more details.

Coding conventions are the same as in core Vaadin.
